# Auto-Update Guide

## How Auto-Updates Work

The app automatically checks for updates on startup and downloads them in the background. When an update is ready, a notification appears at the top of the window with a button to install it.

## How to Trigger an Update

### 1. **Bump Version in `package.json`**
```json
{
  "version": "1.0.4"  // Increment this
}
```

### 2. **Commit and Tag**
```bash
git add package.json
git commit -m "Bump version to 1.0.4"
git tag v1.0.4
git push origin main
git push origin v1.0.4
```

### 3. **GitHub Actions Builds & Publishes**
- The workflow `.github/workflows/build-windows.yml` triggers automatically
- Creates a GitHub release with tag `v1.0.4`
- Uploads the `.exe` installer to the release

### 4. **Users Get Auto-Updated**
- Next time they open the app, it checks for updates
- Downloads the new version in background
- Shows "Update available" notification
- Click "Restart and Update" to install

## Testing Updates

1. Build v1.0.3: `npm run build:win`
2. Install the app from `dist/*.exe`
3. Bump version to v1.0.4, commit, and push tag
4. Wait for GitHub Actions to build
5. Open the installed app â†’ it will detect and download v1.0.4
6. Click the update button to install

## Notes

- Updates only work in **production builds**, not dev mode
- First time users must manually download and install the app
- Subsequent updates are automatic
- No code signing configured (users may see security warnings on Windows)
