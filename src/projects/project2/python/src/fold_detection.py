Simplified Book Fold Detection System
====================================

This module implements a simplified fold detection algorithm using brightness profile
analysis and parabolic curve fitting. The fold is always assumed to be in the center.

Key Functions:
- find_fold_center: Main function for detecting fold position in center ROI
- extract_simple_brightness_profiles: Extract brightness profiles with basic statistics
